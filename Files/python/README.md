Make sure to install `python3` and then pip install `flask` / `flask_cors` packages.

Then use a terminal to navigate to the app's folder and just run this project with: `python3 -m app`

Optionally use VS Code app for editing and running.

I have not tried it but another way of running this project could be within a virtual environment:
 - pip install virtualenv
 - python3 -m venv env
 - pip install flask
 - pip install flask_cors

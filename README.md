# HTML_CSS_JS_Flask
This is a modified version of the [HTML_CSS_JS](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/HTML_CSS_JS) project so check a description of all the features there. It is set to be used with `python3` and `Flask` server.

The main difference is that the `Form` entries are handled by the server so that part of the GUI is slightly different.
If you do test it and upload any pictures then a new `uploads` folder will be created. 

All it takes to run this project is to:
 - Download a zip file of this project (or clone the repo)
 - install python3 and flask package
 - use the command prompt to navigate to the `app` folder and run the following command: `python -m app`.

The server will show you the IP address and the port, generally accessible in the Internet browser via `localhost:5000`.

Optionally use VS Code for editing, troubleshooting and running the app, which should be far easier than using the command prompt.

# HTML_CSS_JS_Flask
This is a modified version of the [HTML_CSS_JS](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/HTML_CSS_JS) project, set to be used with `python3` and `Flask` server. The main difference is that the `Form` entries are handled by the server so that part of the GUI is slightly different.

All it takes is to install python3 and flask package, use command prompt to navigate to the `app` folder and run the following command: `python -m app`.
The server will show you the IP address and port, which is all generally accessible in the Internet browser via `localhost:5000`.

Optionally use VS Code for editing, troubleshooting and running the app, which should be far easier than using the command prompt.
